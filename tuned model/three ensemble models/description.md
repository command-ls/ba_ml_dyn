The ensemble model contains 5 independent models. The five random numbers used for independent model training are 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000, respectively. And because we trained models for the energy and force of the ground state and excited state separately, a total of 10 independent models were saved in each ensemble model directory. In addition, the mean_std directory stores the mean and standard deviation used for scaling the model input and output during training.
